        <p> [Verse 1]<br>
            You tell me I overthink, lost in my mind<br>
            Tracing circles in the dark, looking for a sign<br>
            But you hold my hand, pull me back in<br>
            Say, “Baby, just breathe, let the world begin”<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            You know my heart runs wild, gets caught in the past<br>
            But you speak so soft, like a love that lasts<br><br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            You said, “If you want me to remind you the sky is blue, I would”<br>
            If the rain ever makes you forget, I’ll stand where you stood<br>
            When your heart gets heavy, and the stars lose their light<br>
            I’ll whisper it gently, ‘cause, baby, you shine so bright<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2]<br>
            I chase every shadow, scared they’ll stay<br>
            While you paint the silver lining in every shade of grey<br>
            You don’t ask for much, just to let love through<br>
            And somehow, you make me believe it too<br><br>
            
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            You know my heart runs wild, gets lost in the storm<br>
            But you hold me close, and I feel warm<br><br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            You said, “If you want me to remind you the sky is blue, I would”<br>
            If the rain ever makes you forget, I’ll stand where you stood<br>
            When your heart gets heavy, and the stars lose their light<br>
            I’ll whisper it gently, ‘cause, baby, you shine so bright<br><br>
            
            [Bridge]<br>
            And maybe love is that simple, maybe it’s true<br>
            Not about fixing, just standing with you<br>
            No need for answers, no need for proof<br>
            Just a love that says, “I see you.”<br><br>
            
            [Outro]<br>
            So if I ever forget that the sun will rise<br>
            Would you still be there, with those steady eyes?<br>
            You’d smile and say, “If you need me to… I would.”<br><br>
