            <p> On Promise Day, my heart is true,  <br>
                Like Ruth’s devotion, I promise to you.<br>  
                "Where you go, I’ll go," side by side,  <br>
                In faith and love, we’ll always abide.  <br><br>
                
                With God as our guide, through all we face,  <br>
                I’ll walk with you, in His sweet grace.<br><br>
